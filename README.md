# Hi, I'm Andreas ðŸ‘‹
I am a student at 42 Heilbronn where I (amongst many other things) learn about programming (mainly in C and C++) and UNIX system administration.</br>
</br>
So far I gathered experience with the following technologies:</br>

# Current project:

## Full-stack website with multiplayer pong game and chat <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=nestjs,nodejs,ts,svelte,postgres,docker" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
Together with [alfjl](https://github.com/alfjl), [nijakow](https://github.com/nijakow) and [NL27](https://github.com/NL27), I am currently working on our final project to finish the 42 core curriculum. We have to create a fully functional website with frontend, backend and database. Users will need to run through an authentication process, login and can then play our reinterpretation of the game [Pong (1972)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) agains each other, spectate an ongoing game, chat with other users or browse through user profiles and the highscore board.</br>

# Some of my recent projects:

## [Reeimplementation of STL containers](https://github.com/aenglert42/reimplementing-stl-containers) <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=cpp" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
I reimplemented the standard template library containers std::vector and std::map to practice generic programming.</br>
</br>

## [HTTP Webserver](https://github.com/aenglert42/http-webserver) <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=cpp,nginx" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
Together with [TamLem](https://github.com/TamLem) and [tblaase](https://github.com/tblaase), I created a HTTP webserver (comparable to a light version of [NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/)). To learn about sockets, I/O Multiplexing and HTTP protocols.</br>
</br>

## [Docker infrastructure](https://github.com/aenglert42/my-first-docker-infrastructure) <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=docker,linux,nginx,wordpress,mysql" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
A small docker infrastructure using [NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) to host a [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) website to learn about system administration.</br>
</br>

## [3D Game](https://github.com/aenglert42/Strassenbau-Simulator-3000) <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=c" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
Together with [alfjl](https://github.com/alfjl), I created a small game to learn about ray-casting.</br>
</br>

## [2D Game](https://github.com/aenglert42/so_long_macOS) <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=c" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
A simple tile based game to learn about graphics.</br>
</br>

## [Simulation of the "dining philosophers problem"](https://github.com/aenglert42/dining_philosophers) <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=c" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
A small simulation of the "dining philosophers problem", originally formulated by Edsger Dijkstra. To learn the about threading and resource sharing.</br>
</br>

## [Shell](https://github.com/aenglert42/minishell) <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=c,bash" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
I created a simple shell (comparable to a light version of [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)). To learn about processes, file descriptors and pipes.</br>

# Some of my future projects:

## USB stick sanitizer <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=raspberrypi,python" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
I want to use a Raspberry Pi to build a USB stick sanitizer. A device to safely transfer the content of an untrusted USB stick to a clean one, without taking the risk of plugging it directly into my computer.</br>
</br>

## DNS-based network-wide ad blocker <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=raspberrypi,python" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
I want to use a Raspberry Pi to filter the web before it gets to my devices. This way I can have adfree content on all devices without slowing them down (for example by using a browser based adblocker).</br>
</br>

## Network scanner <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=raspberrypi,python" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
I want to use a Raspberry Pi to build an automatic network scanner to find out what devices are present in the network.</br>
</br>

## Home Automation System with voice activation <img src="https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=arduino,cpp" style="height: 30px; width:auto;"/>
I want to create a simple home automation system by using an arduino to control different devices with voice commands.</br>
