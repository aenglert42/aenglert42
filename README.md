# Hi, I'm Andreas ðŸ‘‹
I'm learning C and C++. Currently I am reimplementing some C++ standard template library containers to practice generic programming.</br>

## Some of my recent projects:

## [Webserver](https://github.com/aenglert42/http-webserver)
Together with [tblaase](https://github.com/tblaase) and [TamLem](https://github.com/TamLem) I created a [HTTP webserver](https://github.com/aenglert42/http-webserver) (comparable to a light version of [NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/)). To learn about sockets, I/O Multiplexing and HTTP protocols.</br>
</br>

## [Docker infrastructure](https://github.com/aenglert42/my-first-docker-infrastructure)
A small [Docker infrastructure](https://github.com/aenglert42/my-first-docker-infrastructure) using [NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/) to host a [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) website to learn about system administration.</br>
</br>

## [3D Game](https://github.com/aenglert42/Strassenbau-Simulator-3000)
Together with [alfjl](https://github.com/alfjl) I created a small [ray-caster game](https://github.com/aenglert42/Strassenbau-Simulator-3000) to learn about ray-casting.</br>
</br>

## [2D Game](https://github.com/aenglert42/so_long_macOS)
A simple [tile based game](https://github.com/aenglert42/so_long_macOS) to learn about graphics.</br>
</br>

## [Simulation for the "dining philosophers problem"](https://github.com/aenglert42/dining_philosophers)
A small [simulation](https://github.com/aenglert42/dining_philosophers) for the "dining philosophers problem", originally formulated by Edsger Dijkstra. To learn the about threading and resource sharing.</br>
</br>

## [Shell](https://github.com/aenglert42/minishell)
I created a simple [shell](https://github.com/aenglert42/minishell) (comparable to a light version of [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)). To learn about processes, file descriptors and pipes.</br>
